# Flow-based Neural Network Models

This repository includes TensorFlow2.x & Keras implementation of the following flow-based models:

1. NICE (Dinh et al., 2014)
2. RealNVP (Dinh et al., 2016)

Following datasets was used for testing each model.

1. Moon-shaped data
2. MNIST

## Conclusions
- Due to the invertibility of layers, it is easy to visualize and interpret layer-wise operations.
- Implementing flow-based models is a bit finicky because the forward/inverse mapping can be changed based on the architecture and frameworks (tensorflow, tensorflow_probability, jax, pytorch).
- The current implementations of NICE and RealNVP is not near perfect nor purely my own work.
